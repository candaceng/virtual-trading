# About
A virtual trading [web app](https://cn23-finance.herokuapp.com/) that uses real time data pulled from the IEX Cloud API. Users can:
- Register for an account 
- Get a stock quote 
- Buy/sell stocks
- View their stock profile  
User profiles are stored in a database managed on PostgreSQL and the web application is hosted on Heroku. 
# How I built it
The dynamic web app was built with Python, using the Flask framework. SQL was used to store the databases of registered users and all stock purchases/sells. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were used for the frontend to style the user interface. IEX Cloud was the platform used to gather real time financial data through their API.
