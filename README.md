# About
A virtual trading web app that lets users trade stocks with real time data. Basic functionality (i.e. registering for an account, getting a stock quote, allowing users to buy/sell stocks, and displaying a user's stock portfolio) was implemented and submitted to Harvard's CS50 online course as part of problem set 8. Additional features are currently being implemented. 
# How I built it
The dynamic web app was built with Python, using the Flask framework. SQL was used to store the databases of registered users and all stock purchases/sells. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were used for the frontend to style the user interface.
